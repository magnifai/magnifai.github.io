<h1 id="how-to-make-your-organization-data-driven-part-1">How to make your Organization Data Driven Part 1</h1>

<p>Maybe you’re the fabled BI developer, brought in to solve all of your organization’s problems with thoughtful data analysis; maybe you’re a career analyst who wants to level up; maybe you’re a organizational veteran who wants to take another angle of attack this year; maybe you’re an executive with a vision.</p>

<p>No matter your path or reasons, you have one goal: enable your organization to make decisions based on data.</p>

<p>Companies are now, more than ever, sitting upon hoards of untapped data capital. While some data collection has evolved organically through need or requirement, other data is accumulating for the sole reason that it’s possible to collect.</p>

<p>I’m not necessarily referring to big data, or the vast accumulated knowledge that the Internet of Things is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-the-internet-of-things-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-iot-right-now/">projected to collect</a>.</p>

<p>I’m talking about the nonprofit down the street that bought a fancy customer data service complete with unutilized and oversold API. I’m talking about the giant maze of spreadsheets being maintained by the finance team at your medium-sized company. I’m talking about the app your company built to run its business, that’s now streaming live, powerful data to a dusty SQL server that no one is querying. I’ve also talking the untapped potential for an organization that isn’t collecting any data yet.</p>

<p>I’m talking about starting small. The low-hanging fruit. The baby steps.</p>

<p>So many organizations I have worked with have lacked the most basic reporting around their operation. Very often, they’re collecting the data to do it! Almost always, people are constantly voicing questions that their data could easily answer.</p>

<p>This is where you come in. You are probably reading this because you know that data is powerful and your organization is missing out on easy efficiency gains. How do you convince the Powers That Be to invest in business intelligence? After all, it’s hard to quantify what exactly the gain from these tools will be given the cost (<a href="https://www.betterbuys.com/bi/roi-business-intelligence/">although you can try</a>).</p>

<p>I want to share with you some strategies for getting your business excited about the data products you can create for them. Acting based on analytics requires a heavy organizational commitment, but with these tools you can start to get the train rolling. Once you provide that initial spark, your coworkers will realize how powerful analytics-based decisions making can be.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> <em>This article assumes the basic understanding of business intelligence products and their applications. By Business Intelligence (oxymoron, I know) I mean the leveraging of data capital to provide business value through analysis and reporting. BI is a catch-all term that encompasses data science, engineering, and visualization.</em></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="focus-on-your-audience">Focus on your audience</h3>

<p>The first step towards effectively engaging your coworkers with thoughtful analytical tools is to adopt a customer-facing mindset. You need to step into your audience’s shoes and understand how a BI tool can integrate seamlessly into their day-to-day. You need to treat your solutions the way a product team would design software: by understanding your user, their pain points, and why your solution makes their life easier.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of any successful business intelligence effort is to enable your users by providing them with quantifiable answers to the questions they wonder. This makes their lives more productive and their decisions more secure.</p>

<p><em>How many units did we sell in the last 6-months? How many employee hours are we billing to XYZ account per week? How much did we spend on services last year?</em> These are questions with quantifiable, exact answers that, when known, enable better decision-making.</p>

<p>Knowing your audience will dictate the level of detail of your tools and metrics, as well as what to display and how.</p>

<p>My methodology for getting started in this process is simple: walk through the 3 DOs. The three DOs are:
<strong>1. What does your audience do day-to-day?</strong>
<strong>2. After using your tool, what will users go do?</strong>
<strong>3. What will users do differently once your tool exists?</strong></p>

<p>Ask yourself these questions and make sure you have firm answers. Having a strong plan of attack built on firm theoretical ground will help your tool be as useful as possible to your customers. At the end of the day, your tool needs to streamline business users’ behavior to strengthen the business.</p>

<p>Talk through these questions with them, framing the questions from an inquisitive rather than an accusatory standpoint. People love to talk about themselves and what they do! They love to have someone focused on enabling them to be better. Make sure you understand what they literally do in their day-to-day job.</p>

<p>I can’t stress this point enough: there is a huge difference between knowing someone’s title and understanding what they spend their time DOING.</p>

<p>Working through this list will help both parties crystallize their understanding of the problem. Remember: your goal here should not be to push pixels and create whatever your customer initially thinks they want. Your goal is to be a solutioner. Do the hard critical thinking up front so you can make the most useful tool possible. You’re also (ideally) the technical expert, so you know what’s possible and what users have found useful in the past.</p>

<p>Thoroughly understanding the use case allows us to make a BI tool meant to tackle a specific problem, rather than developing a catch-all. With the current tools at our disposal, development time can be extremely quick. Don’t try to solve too much at once! This scattered focus will confuse your users, who will find your solution less intuitive to integrate into their routines. Do less better.</p>

<p>Your audience’s position will hugely determine the level of detail of your reporting. Tools for executives will be vastly different in focus than solutions you make for managers.</p>

<p>Focusing on your audience is just the first step to empowering your organization through analytics. Stay tuned for the next article in this four-part series!</p>
